# Coupon Display Exercise for SavingStar
A short, open-ended exercise of designing and implementing a coupon using HTML &amp; CSS.

At the basic level a coupon "cell" consists of a header section (title), body section (image &amp; description) and a footer section (actions, links, etc).

More specifically the final result should be able to :
* Accommodate for text that does not fit in its container (title, description for example)
* Accommodate for various lengths of the description text (1 line vs. 3 lines for example)
* Display an image for the coupon in the body section along side the description
* Allow for the possibility that the content area (between footer and header) can range in height, while allowing the image and description text to remain vertically aligned
* Display a button to activate the coupon in the footer
* Take into account a responsive design for small screen devices vs. large screen devices

Outside of the above feel free to add any other bells and whistles to the coupon cell, and design a means for displaying multiple coupon cells on the same interface.

There are 2 key files already committed as a starting point index.html and style.css, which you can use as a working starting point to add the HTML needed for the coupon's structure and add CSS to control the visual design.
